# Guidlines GUI design for senior users

__from [here](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-for-senior-citizens/):__
- at least 12 pt
- increaseable textsize?
- hyperlinks large, buttons in a way that you can hit them clean
  - avoid tightly clustering
- avoid need of pixel precise pointing
- pull downs, hierarchy walkings are problematic, => no moving interface elements
- make things that work in the first try (seniors hate retry), older people often blame themself -> would be bad user xp
- seniors always read everything as they are methodigally -> not much text per screen?!
- make buttons/links easy as button recognizeable!
- easy simple errormessage, that is simple to fix!

__from [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/designing-digital-technology-for-the-elderly/):__
- high contrast
- don’t make assumptions about prior knowledge.
- interrogate all parts of your design for usability, even the parts you didn’t create.
- easy step by step
- no splitting of tasks over multiple screens
  - logner tasks: clear feedback on progress, goal reminders
- allow for longer timeouts(until e.g. screensaver...)
- avoid dividing users’ attention between multiple tasks or parts of the screen.

#### furthermore:
- after __complete__ release: no interface changes.
  (eldery people tend to hate this as some are using step by step instructions)
