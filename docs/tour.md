This document will discuss how to best implement a tour to show new users the features of
the given ionic app.


## Therefore the following plugins were tested:
- ui-tour: https://github.com/benmarch/angular-ui-tour
  - supports a very easy concept of tour generating:
    - directives with tooltip content and titles are given per tag to describe
- angular-tour: https://github.com/DaftMonk/angular-tour
  - tooltips can also be defined in directives ut also extra elements can be set to be
  tooltips.
